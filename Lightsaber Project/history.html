                <p>The earliest lightsabers that can properly be called as such were designed by the Jedi, but were
                    eventually taken up by the Sith and the Dark Jedi as well. Like later lightsabers, these weapons
                    used a focusing crystal in the hilt to generate the blade. Unlike later lightsabers, they were
                    reliant on a bulky external power pack, which was connected to the hilt with a cable. This naturally
                    made the lightsabers somewhat unwieldy. These weapons saw action in the Hundred-Year Darkness and
                    other conflicts during the Old Republic Era.</p>

                <p>The Sith made technological improvements that gave rise to lightsaber designs that did not require a
                power pack. Wielders of the lightsaber now had much greater freedom of movement during battle. The new
                and improved Sith lightsaber first appeared during the Great Hyperspace War, and the design was soon
                adopted by the Jedi.</p>
