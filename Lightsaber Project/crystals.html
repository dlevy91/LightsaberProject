                    Lightsaber crystals, also known as kyber crystals, were a variety of crystals, gems, stones, or
                    other objects used as the energy source of a lightsaber.

                    Jedi and Sith used a variety of crystals to produce various colors, effects and unique abilities. Some crystals could even enhance the Force skills of a particular user. Other gems, such as colored crystals or diamonds, were used exclusively for prismatic effects. However, not all lightsaber crystals were actually crystals. Plenty of Jedi or Sith used a different material or substance in place of a crystal, such as physical remains, shards of glass, and even special micro machinery.
